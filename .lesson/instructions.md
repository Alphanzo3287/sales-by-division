Given that the XYZ company has 3 divisions and tracks quarterly sales, write a program to prompt the user to input sales for each division for each quarter.  Provide a grand total for all sales and a total for each quarter.

Use the following named constants and variables;

const int NUM_DIVS = 3;

const int NUM_QTRS = 4;

double sales[NUM_DIVS][NUM_QTRS];

double divSales[NUM_DIVS];  

double totalSales;
